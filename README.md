# Dashboard UI Project

This is a dashboard interface built as a front-end project, designed to practice CSS Grid and interactive UI elements as part of the Odin Project.

## Features

- Fully grid-based layout for the main container, sidebar, header, and cards  
- Dashboard list and project cards positioned entirely using CSS Grid  
- Consistent spacing, alignment, and sizing handled through grid tracks and gaps  
- Subtle hover animations on cards and list items for interactive feedback  

## Project Details

The main challenge of this project was **to use only CSS Grid for positioning and layout**, avoiding Flexbox or other layout techniques. This project allowed exploration of:

- Full-grid layouts for the container and content areas  
- Grid-based alignment for sidebar items, cards, and headers  
- Animations applied without breaking the grid structure  

## Improvements

- **Not yet responsive** — the layout currently works best on desktop screens
